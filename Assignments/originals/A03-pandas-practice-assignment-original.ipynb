To complete this assignment, you must replace all the **???** with appropriate values, expressions or statements to ensure that the notebook runs properly end-to-end. \n","\n","Some things to keep in mind:\n","\n","* Make sure to run all the code cells, otherwise you may get errors like `NameError` for undefined variables.\n","* Do not change variable names, delete cells or disturb other existing code. It may cause problems during evaluation.\n","* In some cases, you may need to add some code cells or new statements before or after the line of code containing the **???**. \n","* Since you'll be using a temporary online service for code execution, save your work by running `jovian.commit` at regular intervals.\n","* Questions marked **(Optional)** will not be considered for evaluation, and can be skipped.
